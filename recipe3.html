      <p><em>Zucchini cupcakes are a delightful and moist dessert option that incorporates shredded zucchini into the batter. This addition not only adds a subtle vegetable flavor but also contributes to the cupcakes' moist texture. Typically spiced with cinnamon and nutmeg, these cupcakes offer a unique twist on traditional cupcakes. Zucchini cupcakes are often topped with cream cheese frosting or a dusting of powdered sugar for added sweetness. This creative treat allows for a delicious and unexpected way to enjoy the goodness of zucchini in a dessert form.</em></p>
